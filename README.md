# Facebook-Growth-Analyis

This project shows a detailed Facebook growth analysis using Excel and PowerPoint. The goal was to study how the brand’s presence changed over time—looking at follower growth, post performance, and user engagement.
To protect privacy, the company name, location, and data were changed. Excel helped clean and explore the data with formulas and charts. PowerPoint was used to present insights clearly for easy understanding.
The report highlights useful trends, top-performing posts, and tips for improving content strategy. It helps teams make better social media decisions based on actual data.
